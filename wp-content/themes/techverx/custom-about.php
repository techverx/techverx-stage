<!-- <div class="clear40"></div> -->

<p>Many times a great idea is sparked by a few friends, some great coffee, and the desire to solve a problem. Following through on the idea is what makes for a great start up. When a great team is added to the mix, a successful start up is realized. This was the formula for SplitCommerce. With decades of combined eCommerce and digital infrastructure experience, the founders of SplitCommerce recognized a few important things about the landscape of online selling:</p>

<div class="clear20"></div>

<ul>
    <li>Online retail is quickly overtaking brick and mortar retail in many industries.</li>
    <li>The popular DIY eCommerce platforms are not as simple as they appear.</li>
    <li>It should not cost thousands of dollars for a small business to begin selling online.</li>
</ul>

<div class="clear20"></div>

<p>Our mission is quite simple. We strive to create and continue to improve upon a product that will enable small businesses, at any stage of their digital transition, to embrace online selling as an integral part of their business-for an affordable price. Guided by our inherent desire to level the playing field for small businesses, like our own, we are continuously discovering new ways to deliver high quality products to our clients at a pricing model that is within a small business budget. Technically sound eCommerce platforms, high level content, and professional SEO capabilities are no longer out of reach. And our D.I.F.Y. (Do It For You) services do not require our clients to learn website design. We understand that your specialty is running your business, so we get your online store up and running for you so that you can make sales and service customers.</p>
